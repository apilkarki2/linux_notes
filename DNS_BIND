DNS/BIND

The following assumes Ubuntu

The BIND server is called "named" (as in "name daemon")

Istallation:
Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install bind9 dnsutils

There are three ways to configure Bind9.
1) Caching Nameserver. This will resolve DNS queries and save the results in cache. This will speed up future DNS queries.
2) Primary Master Server. This type of name server is authoritative for its zone. It also is the final say in all DNS queries.
3) Secondary Master Server. Gets DNS records from the primary, but is also authoritative. This is neccessary for Redundancy.

Configuration File:

/etc/bind/named.conf

In "/etc/bind/named.conf.options" their is a "directory" directive. DNS looks for files relative to this directory.

CACHING NAMESERVER)

The default behavior for BIND is to act as a cacheing nameserver. Simply change the following lines in "/etc/bind/named.conf.opions"

        // forwarders {
        //      0.0.0.0;
        // }

To point to your ISPs DNS servers (I am using OpenDNS servers).

	forwarders {
		208.67.222.222;
		208.67.220.220;
	}

Finally, restart named with 
$ sudo service bind9 restart

Enable bind9 at startup


PRIMARY NAMESERVER)



SECONDARY NAMESERVER)
