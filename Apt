Ubuntu Repositories:
Main - Officially supported software under a free license
Restricted - Supported software without a free license (proprietary)
Universe - Community maintained software
Multiverse - Software that is not free

The list of repositories where software can be obtained are found in the repository configuration files:
/etc/apt/sources.list
/etc/apt/sources.list.d

Here is a sample from "/etc/apt/sources.list"
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main restricted
deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main restricted

Repos/archives prefixed by "deb" contain software binaries (already compiled software). Those prefixed by "deb-src" contain source code. It is sometimes desirable to download source code
as this allows you to get the cutting edge newest version of a package right from the devoloper. It also allows you to read the source code and make any changes before you compile it to binary data.

If you are going to edit /etc/apt/sources.list, make sure you back it up:
# cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup

Whenever you edit these files, make sure to run "apt-get update" afterwards to update the APT database with the newest available packages.

Always use the following command to get the latest packages:
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install {package-name}

To remove a package as well as packages that depend on it (but keep its config files):
$ sudo apt-get remove {package-name}

To remove the configuration files as well:
$ sudo apt-get purge {package-name}

To upgrade all packages to their newest possible version (for security patches, added features, etc..:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -u upgrade


Searching for packages:
$ apt-cache search {regular-expression}

For more details about a particular package:
$ apt-cache show {package-name}

To show other packages a package depends upon:
$ apt-cache depends {package-name}

To find all files a package has installed:
$ dpkg -L {package name}

For example, if you needed to find where a package placed its database files, you could do the following:
# dpkg -L bind9 | grep db
/etc/bind/db.0
/etc/bind/db.255
/etc/bind/db.empty
/etc/bind/db.127
/etc/bind/db.root
/etc/bind/db.local

To see ALL installed packages:
$ dpkg -l

This is useful for finding if a particular package is installed, for example to see if Apache HTTPD is installed:
$ dpkg -l | grep apache
ii  apache2                                                     2.4.7-1ubuntu4.8                      amd64        Apache HTTP Server
ii  apache2-bin                                                 2.4.7-1ubuntu4.8                      amd64        Apache HTTP Server (binary files and modules)
ii  apache2-data                                                2.4.7-1ubuntu4.8                      all          Apache HTTP Server (common files)
ii  apache2-doc                                                 2.4.7-1ubuntu4.8                      all          Apache HTTP Server (on-site documentation)
ii  libapache-pom-java                                          10-2build1                            all          Maven metadata for all Apache Software projects
ii  libapache2-mod-php5                                         5.5.9+dfsg-1ubuntu4.14                amd64        server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (Apache 2 module)
ii  libbatik-java                                               1.7.ubuntu-8ubuntu2.14.04.1           all          xml.apache.org SVG Library

To add a repository to "/etc/apt/sources.list" you can simply edit it manually:


To download source code from a "deb-src" repo:
$ sudo apt-get source {packagename}

To have APT auto build a package:
$ sudo apt-get source -b {package-name}

And to have dpkg install the freshly built and compiled package:
$ sudo dpkg -i {package}.deb

Common Errors:
If you receive the error "E: Dynamic MMap ran out of room" when running apt-get update, add the following line to /etc/apt/apt.conf:

     APT::Cache-Limit 10000000;
