Centos / RHEL 7 Kickstarts

A Kickstart file must be placed in one of the following locations:

    On removable media, such as a DVD or USB flash drive
    On a hard drive connected to the installation system
    **On a network share reachable from the installation system** 

Location: /root/anaconda-ks.cfg

Introduction:


	Takes the values of installed system. It is a good idea to backup this file up if you plan on making changes to it (or better yet use version control if you plan on make lots of changes).

	KS sections must follow the order:
	1) Command section
	2) %packages section
	3) %pre and %post sections (can be in any order, not required)

	Items within each section do not need to appear in any particular order. %packages, %pre, and %post sections must end with an %end tag.

Verifying your Kickstart file:

To verify your custom kickstart file is syntactically correct and will work, you can use the "ksvalidator" tool

# yum install pykickstart
# ksvalidator $PATH_TO_KICKSTART_FILE













Terminology:

An installation tree is a copy of the binary Red Hat Enterprise Linux DVD with the same directory structure.
