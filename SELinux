SELinux:

Configuration file located at:
/etc/selinux/semanage.conf

Has 3 modes of operation:

1) Enforcing
Denies access and logs events to /var/log/audit.log (Default)
2) Permissive
logs events to /var/log/audit.log but does NOT restrict access (useful for troubleshooting)
3) Disabled
SELinux is off.

Use the following command to see status of SELinux:
# sestatus

Use the following to switch between Enforcing and Permissive mode on the fly:
permissive
# setenforce 0 
enforcing
# setenforce 1

NOTE: The above command does not survive reboot. To make the effects persist through reboot, you must edit /etc/selinux/config, and set the "SELINUX=" directive. You should reboot your system for changes to take effect.
