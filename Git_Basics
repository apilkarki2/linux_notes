$ git help

$ man git

To initialize a git repository
$ git init

Basics Git workflow:
1) Make changes to files.
2) Stage changed files to "Staging Area"
3) Files in the "Staging Area" can be commited. This makes permanant changes to repository, thus creating a save point.

To view status of current repository (view changed files, and pending commits):
$ git status

To stage changed files for commit
$ git add <filename or glob expression>

To commit changes to repository
$ git commit -m "Message describing changes"

To see history/log of git commits
$ git log

If you make a change to a file, you can see how it differs from the last commit with
$ git diff <filename>

UNDOING MISTAKES
http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html

A Git HEAD is the last commit made on your current branch. To view this:
$ git show HEAD

Unstage files from last commit.
$ git reset HEAD <file>

Unstage files
$ git reset SHA <file>

Unstage any staged files after last commit. This will undo any changes made to any files since last commit. 
$ git checkout HEAD <filename>

It is useful to run a "git diff <file>" to see if you messed up a file. If you did, use "git checkout HEAD <file>" to 
revert it to the last commit (if you royaly screwed it up beyond repair)
